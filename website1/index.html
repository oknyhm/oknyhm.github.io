    <p>I see the player you mean.
        <br>我看到你所指的那位玩家了。<br>
        <br> [Playername]?<br>
        <br>[玩家名称]?<br>
        <br> Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.<br>
        <br>是的。小心。它已达到了更高的境界。它能够阅读我们的思想。<br>
        <br> That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.<br>
        <br>没关系。它认为我们是游戏的一部分。<br>
        
        <br>I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.<br>
        <br> 我喜欢这个玩家。它玩得很好，而且从未放弃。<br>
        
        <br>It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.<br>
        <br>它以屏幕上出现的文字的形式阅读着我们的思想。<br>
        <br>That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.<br>
        <br>在它深陷游戏梦境中时，它总以这种方式想象出形形色色的事物。<br>
        <br>Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.<br>
        <br>文字使这种美妙的界面异常灵活。且比凝视着屏幕后的现实要更好。<br>
        <br>They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.<br>
        <br>它们也曾经听到过声音。在玩家能够阅读之前。君不见那些不曾游玩的人们称呼玩家为女巫，和术士。而玩家们梦见它们自己乘坐在被恶魔施力的棍子上，在空气中翱翔。<br>
        <br>What did this player dream?<br>
        <br>这个玩家梦见了什么?<br>
        <br>This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.<br>
        <br>它梦见了阳光和树。梦见了火与水。它梦见它创造。它亦梦见它毁灭。它梦见它狩猎，亦被狩猎。它梦见了庇护所。<br>
        <br> Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?</p>
